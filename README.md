# DiceGame:

This program simulates rolling a die, the number of times you input.
It started out with some issues. The die did not roll 1 and 6 as much as any other number. This has been fixed and is shown in a JUnit-test. Now it simulates true randomness.

Furthermore we use a regular expression in the UseDice.java file to test if the user input is valid. Before the program would crash if it was not given an integer.
